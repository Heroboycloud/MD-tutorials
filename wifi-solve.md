It sounds like you're facing Wi-Fi connectivity issues after installing Ubuntu alongside Windows. Here are some steps to diagnose and fix the problem:

---

### **1. Check if Wi-Fi is recognized**
Run the following commands in the terminal (`Ctrl+Alt+T`):

```bash
lspci -knn | grep -iA3 net  # Check if Wi-Fi adapter is detected
ip a                       # Check network interfaces (look for "wlan0" or similar)
rfkill list all            # Check if Wi-Fi is blocked
```

- If `rfkill` shows **Soft/Hard blocked**, unblock it:
  ```bash
  sudo rfkill unblock all
  ```

---

### **2. Check if the Wi-Fi driver is loaded**
```bash
lsmod | grep wifi  # Check loaded modules
```

- If no driver is loaded, identify your Wi-Fi chipset:
  ```bash
  lspci -v | grep -i network
  ```
  or for USB adapters:
  ```bash
  lsusb
  ```

- Once you know the chipset (e.g., `Intel`, `Realtek`, `Broadcom`), install the correct driver:
  - **Intel**: Usually works out of the box (try `sudo apt install firmware-iwlwifi`).
  - **Realtek**: May need `sudo apt install rtl8821ce-dkms` (or similar).
  - **Broadcom**: Run `sudo apt install bcmwl-kernel-source`.

---

### **3. Restart Network Services**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart network-manager
sudo systemctl enable network-manager
```

---

### **4. Check for Secure Boot Issues**
If Secure Boot is enabled in BIOS, it may block unsigned drivers. Disable it temporarily:
1. Reboot → Enter BIOS (usually `F2`, `Del`, or `Esc`).
2. Disable **Secure Boot**.
3. Save & reboot.

---

### **5. Manually Install Missing Firmware**
Some Wi-Fi cards require additional firmware:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --reinstall linux-firmware
```

---

### **6. Check for Conflicting Drivers (if dual-booting with Windows)**
Windows "Fast Startup" can sometimes lock the Wi-Fi adapter. Disable it:
1. Boot into Windows.
2. Go to **Power Options** → **Choose what the power buttons do** → **Disable Fast Startup**.
3. Shut down (do not restart) and boot back into Ubuntu.

---

### **7. Try a USB Wi-Fi Adapter (Temporary Fix)**
If nothing works, use a USB Wi-Fi adapter (many work out of the box).

---

### **8. Check Logs for Errors**
```bash
dmesg | grep wifi  # Look for errors
journalctl -u NetworkManager --no-pager | tail -n 50
```

---

### **Common Fixes for Specific Chipsets**
- **Realtek RTL8821CE/RTL8723DE**:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install git dkms
  git clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new.git
  cd rtlwifi_new
  make && sudo make install
  sudo modprobe -r rtl8723de && sudo modprobe rtl8723de
  ```
- **Broadcom BCM43xx**:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install firmware-b43-installer
  ```

---

### **Final Steps**
- Reboot after trying fixes:
  ```bash
  sudo reboot
  ```
- If still not working, search for your specific chipset + "Ubuntu driver" (e.g., "RTL8821CE Ubuntu 22.04 driver").

Let me know your Wi-Fi chipset (from `lspci` or `lsusb`) if you need more specific help!
